LWC is a mod for hMod that facilitates chest protection and management of said chests.

It is simple yet advanced. It supports public chests, private chests, and even passworded chests. It has protections against Explosions (TNT, Creepers). 
Group and user chest creation limits can be created.

This plugin is as in-depth as you want it to be. It can either serve as a simple protection mod or for some users, they will take advantage of chest admins, limits, etc.

To get started, users who will have access to use it only need to have access to the command "/lwc". Typing /lwc ingame will bring up detailed help documentation
